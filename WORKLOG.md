## 2026-08-11 — Composite Device and Logic Unit documentation

### Requested
- Add a universal Homey device that combines the same capability from multiple devices.
- Support humidity min/max and broader numeric, boolean/alarm, text, enum, and clock-time use cases.
- Verify and improve the published Logic Unit usage documentation.
- Create the Composite Device image assets and publish the app.

### Implemented
- Added the `composite-device` driver with a visual capability, operation, source-device, and name pairing page.
- Added `CompositeAggregator.js` with numeric average/min/max/sum/median; boolean any/all/majority/count/percentage; text/enum mode/min/max/newest; and circular average clock time.
- Added dynamic numeric, alarm, and text capabilities plus realtime source listeners, partial-source error reporting, periodic reconnection, and listener cleanup.
- Added unit/device/driver tests and retained the pending Logic Device restart and Circadian Light Group member-verification fixes already present in the worktree.
- Added a Composite Device guide, updated the device overview and README, and added existing Logic Unit settings/Flow screenshots to the published documentation.
- Reworked the supplied Composite Device raster into a transparent master and derived 500 × 500 and 75 × 75 Homey assets; verified the enclosed background gaps between pins are transparent.

### Verification
- `npm test -- --runInBand`: 7 suites, 133 tests passed.
- `homey app validate`: passed at publish level.
- `homey app run --remote`: installed and initialized successfully on the configured Homey Pro; the Composite Device driver initialized without errors.

### Release
- Published Homey Build 49 as version 1.10.20 in the test channel.
- Installed version 1.10.20 on the configured Homey Pro after the remote development run.
- Committed the implementation and documentation for GitHub publication.
